Using stock periods
===================

You can use `Stock Periods <model-stock.period>` to stop
`Stock Moves <model-stock.move>` being created or updated before a specific
date, and to improve the performance of Tryton when looking at and using
`Product Quantities <concept-product.quantity>`.

.. tip::

   Depending on the number of stock moves that your
   `Company <company:model-company.company>` generates you may find it useful
   to create new stock periods as part of your accounting period end, or
   fiscal year end, processes.
